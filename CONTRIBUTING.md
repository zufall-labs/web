# Contributing to Zufall Labs Projects

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our projects! It's people like you that make our organization great. We welcome contributions from everyone, and we are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.
- Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest `main` or development branch in the repository.
- Isolate the problem — create a reduced test case and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

- Use the GitHub issue search — check if the enhancement has already been suggested.
- Check if the enhancement has already been implemented — try to reproduce it using the latest `main` or development branch in the repository.
- Suggest your change in a new issue on GitHub.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Azufall-labs+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood%22first%22issue+is%3Aopen&type=Issues) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3A[OrganizationName]+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help%22wanted%22+is%3Aopen&type=Issues) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

### Pull Requests
